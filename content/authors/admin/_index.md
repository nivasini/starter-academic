I am a Computer Science Master's student at the [University of Waterloo](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/), where I am advised by [Prof. Shai Ben-David](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shai/). Toward my thesis, I am working on problems in formalizing and building tools for Machine Learning under ethics and safety requirements. I also work on Bandit problems with [Prof. Csaba Szepesv√°ri](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~szepesva/) and [Prof. Lin Yang](http://drlinyang.net/).

I completed my Bachelor's degree at the University of Waterloo, majoring in Computer Science and Combinatorics and Optimization. 

Here is my {{% staticref "files/cv.pdf" %}}CV{{% /staticref %}} with more information.
